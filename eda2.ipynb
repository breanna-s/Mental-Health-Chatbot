These episodes can last from just days to months, and you can go for a long period of time between episodes of having no symptoms. Mania is characterized by a restlessness, energetic mind, and inability to settle, and can be accompanied by a break from reality, a.k.a. psychosis. Hypomania is a less intense version of this. Depression is characterized by lethargy, disinterest in normal activities, and a lack of joy or emotion.\n",

You should seek a diagnosis from a mental health professional, who will be able to recommend a course of action that may include medication to suppress these mood swings or talk therapy. You should also speak to those close to you and ask if they have any outside perspectives to offer about your behavior, and tell them about your struggles.\n",

I recommend you seek a psychiatrist or similar mental health professional to determine what assistance will best help you lead a productive, whole life, and to reach out to communities online who understand what you’re going through, specifically those communities that are focused on managing the dysfunctional aspects of your specific disorder. With treatment, most people who experience issues stemming from their personality disorder are able to get better and find success.\n",
